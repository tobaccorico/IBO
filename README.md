even though we borrow check with [gorbagio](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1947643967039823998)

it can't just be 1 node.js script on AWS...    
who's paper chasin', paid per [chase](https://x.com/therealchaseeb/),

clean is like...so obsessively;    
there's .so files in Solana and  
on Android, strangely enough...  
  
wisdom of the crowd async meetings,  
join only if you `batchSwap` on evm  
or hold any synthetic Perena stock.  

People ask a question...what's in a minute?
