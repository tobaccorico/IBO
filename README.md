The irony of the garbage collector is that  
even though we borrow check with gorbagio  
when we collect the garbage (liquidations),  
it can't just be 1 node.js script on AWS...

It's a journey: "reach heart"  
a synonym for my last name,    
IMA means mom in Hebrew;  
IMO is the emo version.  
IBO is the I Bet on One.  
[lil bit](https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/c322f536-e9ad-4cab-a57e-78f82de2739a) but big expense.   

The way this mother represents:  
if anyone can cook, it's her...    
clean is like...so obsessively;    
there's .so files in Solana and  
[on Android, strangely enough](https://github.com/tobaccorico/IMO/tree/main/java)...  
  
wisdom of the crowd async meetings,  
join only if evm `batchSwap` or  
by holding synthetic Perena stock.  

People ask a question...what's in a minute?   
And I tell 'em...5 минут назад я bill TAM...   
9 stablecoins cross chain addressable market.   

9 years ago Venice Beach introduced me to Maya,     
and an app called Spinrilla; [cookin' nothin](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1946153473185132996)

## basic features 

- Android-only (for now) with no distribution via Play Store  
because we sorta violate YouTube's policy. You enter a link  
and the app downloads the audio so you can spit on top...  

- USD star on Solana, or quid in `evm` triple double fork. 

    - Challenge friends on Twitter to a verbal [basketball](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1947643967039823998) battle:  
        - Login twitter is fit for purpose, thread bombing lyrics.  
        To fit the character limit, a verse can't be longer than  
        some delimeter. 35 seconds. done. And only 4 of those fit  
        in a video. 2 minutes 20 seconds is body of thread kickoff.  

No cheating! ["It takes more than an axe to tax."](https://x.com/QuidMint/status/1942724536413167944)   
Not anti-AI either though. supply your API keys.     
how we look at he who says how we look at all?

### Advanced AI features (future work exo-CoCo)
- The iOS version talks to my Apple Watch that starts recording  
when I do a very abrupt shake on the accelerometer. It can offer  
next likeliest word hints on the face of the watch, or even 
instead of   
choosing an instrumental yourself, just insert a link to your YouTube  
 playlist of most favorite instrumentals,
then AI will at least shortlist  
 (if not provide the best match)
depending on the rhyme scheme of  
 your recorded vocal, [
ambiance of your .env reading for the evening](https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/)

- ~~The recordings library has to be encrypted, passcode entry.  
not writing this code myself; use the link phantom
feature  
to do it for us.~~ [this is 
the last resort](https://www.instagram.com/p/DMJ7AykM7Y1/) (to have ammo on hand)  

- I don't know about you, but when I'm freestyling  
    half the words are only half-words...like...could be   
    1 word or multiple (not quite as bat as mumble rap)...   
    So to raise coherence, without wasting too much time  
    (we all busy) 11labs can do some heavy lifting for us...  

- Token-gated access to these is a form of shareholder meeting  
preparation, giving AI agents access to privileged information  

- Finally, if you don't want testimony recording to include    
your camera, Gemini will whip up a video for you given   
transcribed lyrics (your final edit version) as a prompt...  
we don't need Solana Saga TEE to ensure the app's integrity   
(preventing tampering with the APK, since interactions affect    
an escrow attestation). Users are encouraged to eventually    
replace 11labs with their own [exo-tech](https://github.com/exo-explore/exo), exo-Switchboard...
